#esp_sds011

Arduino library for the SDS011 particulate matter sensor attached to the
ESP8266 or ESP32 SOC micro controllers.

The SDS011 is a particulate matter sensor by Nova Fitness.

This library works with the EspSoftwareSerial library on ESP8266 and ESP32,
and can also utilize the hardware serial devices on ESP32.
At 9600bps, using a simulated UART poses no difficulty to either of the
supported SOCs.
